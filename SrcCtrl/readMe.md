# Source Control Final Assignment

Due to some problem the name of the parent folder, the solution file (.sln) and the csproj file is  "SourceControlFInalAssignment" i.e. the 'i' in Final is uppercase, whereas due to updating the 'i' in Final in the whole project (namespaces and all) is in lowercase. So, if any problem arisies please create a new issue i will try to solve it as soon as possible.
